### Portfolio 1

This portfolio piece is meant to build off of the code done in lab 4 where we worked on 
creating a menu with different items and names passed into it.

Before accessing the menu users are sent to a login page where they have to insert their first name and reservation time. 
Once this is done, they can hit the submit button where they will then be brought to a main menu screen similar to 
the one created in lab 5. 

Here I have different options listed such as appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages. In 
each menu selection will then list the menu items which includes itemId, itemPrice, itemName, itemDescription. 
There will be two buttons under each menu item that has add to cart and remove from cart. 

There is also a total button which will show the values of selected onclick menu options
the user has selected. This display will look similar to a receipt with each item listed on it.
