### Portfolio 1

This portfolio piece is meant to build off of the code done in lab 4 where we worked on 
creating a menu with different items and names passed into it.

Before accessing the menu users are sent to a login page where they have to insert their first name and reservation time. 
Once this is done, they can hit the submit button where they will then be brought to a main menu screen similar to 
the one created in lab 5. 

Here I have different options listed such as appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages. In 
each menu selection will then list the menu items which includes itemId, itemPrice, itemName, itemDescription. 
There will be two buttons under each menu item that has add to cart and remove from cart. 

There is also a total button which will show the values of selected onclick menu options
the user has selected. This display will look similar to a receipt with each item listed on it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
